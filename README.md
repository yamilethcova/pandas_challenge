PyCity Schools Analysis - Yamileth Cova 

 Analysis has multiples perspectives depending on what type of information you are looking for: 
 
 1)We can say that charter schools are more successful due they have a higher percentage rate of their students passing overall (math and reading) with only half of the budget; take as an example Bailey High School - District School vs Cabrera High School - Charter School, even when the district's school gets more budget and spend more per student the charter school in overall perform better.

   2) I understand the size of the school matter; however, let's take a sample of 2 same-size schools and see the grades from 9th to 12th form 
  Bailey High School vs Wilson High School.

  District High Schools need to pay attention to how they are distributing/investing their budget because you can't see the result; more money has been given per student and  less results in comparison with Charter schools district school
